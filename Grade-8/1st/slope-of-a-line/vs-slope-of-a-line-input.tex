Slope: the steepness of a line

%\begin{itemize} 
%\item 
The slope $\ {m }$ of a line can be computed by finding the quotient of the rise and the run. \[\ {m=\displaystyle  \frac{rise}{run}}\] 

%\item 
The slope $\ {m }$  of the line passing through two points $\ { P_1(x_1, y_1)}$   and $\ {P_2(x_2, y_2) }$  is given by
\begin{center}
 $\ {m = \displaystyle  \frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}}$, where  $\ {x_1 \neq x_2 }$.
\end{center} 
%\item 
The slope of the horizontal line is zero while that of the vertical line is undefined. 
%\item 

The value of the slope $\ {m }$  tells the trend of the graph. 
%\begin{itemize} 
%\item 

If $\ {m }$ is positive, then the graph is increasing from left to right.
%\item 

If $\ {m }$ is negative, then the graph is decreasing from left to right.
%\item 

If $\ {m }$ is zero, then the graph is a horizontal  line.
%\item 

If $\ {m }$ is undefined, then the graph is a vertical line.
%\end{itemize}
