\textbf{Cube of a Binomial}
\end{center}

\vspace*{1ex}

To find the cube of a binomial of the form $(x~+~y)^{3}$:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Find the cube of each term to get the first and the last terms.      
\item The second term is three  times the product of the  square of the first term and the second term.
\item The third term is three  times the product of the first term and the square of the second term.
\end{enumerate}

In  symbols,  
$$(x + y)^{3} = x^{3} + 3x^{2}y + 3xy^{2} + y^{3}. $$
