\vspace*{1ex}

\textbf{X-intercept of a line}: the abscissa of the point where the line intersects the x-axis, at which $y = 0$  
\vspce 

\textbf{Y-intercept of a line}:  the ordinate of the point where the line intersects the y-axis, at which $x=0$ 

\vspce 

To find the x-intercept of a linear equation, set $y$ to 0 and solve for $x$. 

\vspce 

To get the y-intercept, set $x$ to 0 and solve for $y$.
