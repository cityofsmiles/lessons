\def \LearningCompetenciesDay {}

\def \ObjectivesDay {
\item Recognize the steps in factoring the difference of two squares with distributive multiplication; 
\item Find the factors of an algebraic expression using the greatest common monomial factor; and, 
\item Project willingness and willingness in solving problems.
}

\def \PurposeDay {The purpose of this lesson is to enable the students to solve real life problems by factoring the difference of two squares.}  

\def \ApplicationDay { Let the students answer the following questions: 
\begin{enumerate}[label = \arabic*. ]
%1
\item In what real life situations or problems can we observe some examples of factoring? 
%2
\item How can you apply your knowledge of factoring the difference of two squares in solving these real life problems? 
\end{enumerate}   
}

\def \GeneralizationDay {Let the students answer the following questions: 
\begin{enumerate}[label = \arabic*. ]
%1
\item In your own words, how do we  factor the greatest common monomial factor? 
%2
\item How do we solve problems involving algebraic expressions that require  factoring the difference of two squares? 
\end{enumerate}
