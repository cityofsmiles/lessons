In solving rational equations:
\begin{enumerate}[label = \arabic*. ]
%%begin{multicols}{2}
%1
\item Determine which values of the variable are not permissible in the expression.
%2
\item Determine the LCD of all rational expressions.
%3
\item Multiply both sides of the equation by the LCD.
%4
\item Simplify the equation by removing the parenthesis and combining similar terms.
%5
\item Solve the equation resulting from step 4.
%6
\item Check for extraneous solution.
