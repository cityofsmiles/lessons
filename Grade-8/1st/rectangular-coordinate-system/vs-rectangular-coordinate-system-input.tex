\vspce

Rectangular Coordinate System or 
 Cartesian Plane: constructed by drawing two perpendicular lines wherein the point of intersection is called the \emph{origin  }

\vspce 

Coordinate axes: the two perpendicular lines

\vspce 

X-Axis: the horizontal line

\vspce 

Y-Axis: the vertical line

\vspce 

Quadrants: the four regions that divide the plane

\vspce 

Coordinates: the ordered pair of real numbers that corresponds to each point in the plane

\vspce

X-Coordinate or Abscissa: the first number of the ordered pair

\vspce 

Y-Coordinate or Ordinate: the second  number of the ordered pair
