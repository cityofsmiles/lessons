\def \PurposeDay {The purpose of this lesson is to enable the students to solve real life problems involving rational equations.}  

\def \ApplicationDay { Let the students answer the following questions: 
\begin{enumerate}[label = \arabic*. ]
%1
\item In what real life situations or problems can we observe some examples of rational equations? 
%2
\item How can you apply your knowledge of rational equations in solving these real life problems? 
\end{enumerate}   
}

\def \GeneralizationDay {Let the students answer the following questions: 
\begin{enumerate}[label = \arabic*. ]
%1
\item In your own words, what are rational equations?
