Linear Equation: an equation in two variables which can be written in two forms: 
\begin{itemize} 
\item Standard Form: $\ {Ax+By=C }$, where $\ { A}$, $\ { B}$, and $\ { C \in \Re}$ and $\ { A}$ and $\ { B}$ not both 0
\item Slope-Intercept Form: $\ {y=mx+b }$, where $\ { m}$ is the slope and $\ {b }$ is the y-intercept, $\ { m}$ and $\ { b \in\Re}$ 
\end{itemize}
