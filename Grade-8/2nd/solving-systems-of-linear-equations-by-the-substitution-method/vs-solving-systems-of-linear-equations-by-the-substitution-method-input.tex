Procedures for the Substitution Method 
\begin{enumerate}[label = \arabic*. ]
\item Solve for one variable in terms of the other variable in one of the equations.
\item Substitute the value of the variable found in the first step of the second equation.
\item Simplify then solve the resulting equation.
\item Substitute the value obtained to any of the original equations. 
\item Check the values of the variables obtained against the linear equations in the system. 
\end{enumerate}
