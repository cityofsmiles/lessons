\textbf{Graphical Solutions of Systems of Linear Inequalities in Two Variables}

\vspace*{1ex}

An ordered pair $(x, y)$ is a \textbf{solution} to a system of inequalities if it satisfies all the inequalities in the system.

\vspce 

Graphically, the coordinates of a point that lie on the graphs of all inequalities in the system is part of its solution.

\vspce 

To solve a system of inequalities in two variables by graphing: 
\begin{enumerate}[label = \arabic*. ]
%1
\item Draw the graph of each inequality on the same coordinate plane. Shade the appropriate half-plane. 
%2
\item The region where shaded areas overlap is the graphical solution to the system. If the graphs do not overlap, then the system has no solution.

\end{enumerate}
