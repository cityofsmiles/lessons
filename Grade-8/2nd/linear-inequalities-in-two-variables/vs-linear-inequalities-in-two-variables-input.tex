\textbf{Linear Inequality in Two Variables:} an inequality which can be written in any one of the following forms 

\begin{center}
\noindent\begin{minipage}{\textwidth}
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{YY}
$Ax+By<C$ & $Ax+By \leq C$ \\
$Ax+By>C$ & $Ax+By \geq C$ \\
\end{tabularx} 
\end{minipage}
\end{center} 

where $A$, $B$,  and $C$ are any real numbers.

The solution of an inequality in two variables are the ordered pairs of numbers that make the inequality true.

How to Graph Linear Inequalities in Two Variables

\begin{enumerate}[label = \arabic*. ]
%1
\item Graph the corresponding equation. Use broken line if inequality is not included and a
solid line if inequality is included.
%2
\item Choose a point on the plane not on the line and substitute its coordinate in the inequality.
%3
\item If the inequality is satisfied, shade the region containing that point. If not, shade the other region.

\end{enumerate}
