Procedures for the Elimination Method 
\begin{enumerate}[label = \arabic*. ]
\item Rewrite both equations in standard form. 
\item Multiply either equation or both equations by a nonzero number so that the coefficients of $x$ or $y$ will have a sum of 0.
\item Add the resulting equations.
\item Simplify then solve the resulting equation.
\item Substitute the value obtained to any of the original equations. 
\item Check the values of the variables obtained against the linear equations in the system. 
\end{enumerate}
