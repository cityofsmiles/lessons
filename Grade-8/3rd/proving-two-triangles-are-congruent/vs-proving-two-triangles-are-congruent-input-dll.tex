SAA/AAS (Side-Angle-Angle) Theorem: 
If two angles and a non-included side of one triangle are congruent to the corresponding two angles and a non-induded side of another triangle, then the triangles are congruent.

Isosceles Triangle Theorem:  
If two sides of a triangle are congruent, then the angles opposite those sides are congruent.

Converse of Isosceles Triangle Theorem:  If two angles of a triangle are congruent, then the sides opposite those angles are also congruent.

An equilateral triangle is also equiangular.

LL  Congruence Theorem:  If  the  legs  of  one  right  triangle  are  congruent  to  the  legs  of  another  right  triangle,  then the triangles are congruent.

LA (Leg-Acute angle) Congruence Theorem:  If  a  leg  and  an  acute  angle  of  one  right  triangle  are  congruent  to  a  leg  and  an  acute angle of another right triangle, then the triangles are congruent.
