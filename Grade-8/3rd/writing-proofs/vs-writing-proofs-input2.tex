Postulates 

\begin{enumerate}[label = \arabic*. ]
\item Linear Pair Postulate: If two angles form a linear pair, then they are supplementary.
\item Segment Addition Postulate: If $B$ lies on $\overline{AC}$, then $AC = AB + BC$.
\item Angle Addition Postulate: If $B$ is in the interior of $\angle{AOC}$, then $m\angle{AOC} = m\angle{AOB} + m\angle{BOC}$.
\end{enumerate}

Theorems 

\begin{enumerate}[label = \arabic*. ]
\item Vertical Angle Theorem: If two angles are vertical, then they are congruent.
\item Angle Sum Theorem: The sum of the measures of the interior angles of a triangle is $180\degree$. 
\item Complementary Theorem: If two angles are complement of the same (or congruent) angles, then they are congruent.
\item Supplement Theorem: If two angles are supplement of the same (or congruent) angles, then they are congruent. 
\end{enumerate}
