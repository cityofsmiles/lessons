Unequal Sides Theorem: 
 If the lengths of the sides of a triangle are not equal, then the angles opposite these sides are also not equal and the larger angle is opposite the longer side.
 
\vspce 

Unequal Angles Theorem: If the measure of the three angles of a triangle is not equal, the sides opposite the angles are also not equal and the longer side is opposite the larger angle. 

\vspce 

Triangle Inequality Theorem: The sum of the length of the two sides of a triangle is greater than the third side.

\vspce 

The Exterior Angle Theorem 1: The measure of an exterior angle of a triangle is greater than the measure of either remote interior angle.

\vspce 

The Exterior Angle Theorem 2: The measure of the exterior angle of a triangle is equal to the sum of the measures of the two remote interior angles.
