\vspce

Included angle: the angle between two sides of a triangle 

\vspce 

Included side: the side common to  two angles  of a triangle 


\vspce 

SSS (Side-Side-Side) Congruence Postulate: If the three sides of one triangle are congruent to the corresponding sides of another triangle, then the two triangles are congruent.

\vspce 

SAS (Side-Angle-Side) Congruence Postulate: 

If the two sides and an included angle of one triangle are congruent to the corresponding  two sides and included angle of another triangle, then the two triangles are congruent.

\vspce 

ASA (Angle-Side-Angle) Congruence Postulate: If two angles and the included side of one triangle are congruent to the corresponding two angles and included side of another triangle, then the two triangles are congruent. 

\vspce 

HL (Hypotenuse-Leg) Congruence Postulate: If the hypotenuse and a leg of one right triangle are congruent to the corresponding hypotenuse and side of another right triangle, then the two right triangles are congruent.
