\vspace*{1ex}

Probability: a measure that is associated with how certain we are of outcomes of a particular experiment or activity

\vspce

Experiment: a planned operation carried out under controlled conditions

\vspce

Chance Experiment: an experiment whose result is not predetermined

\vspce

Outcome: a result of an experiment 

\vspce

Sample Space: the list of all the possible outcomes of an experiment

\vspce

Ways to Represent a Sample Space: 
\begin{enumerate}[label = \arabic*. ]
%1
\item List the possible outcomes
%2
\item Create a tree diagram
%3
\item Create a Venn
diagram

\end{enumerate}  

\vspce

Event: any combination of outcomes

\vspce

Equally likely: each outcome of an experiment occurs with equal probability
