\textbf{Probability of an Event}

\vspace*{1ex}

If an event $E$ has $n(E)$ equally likely outcomes and its sample space $S$ has $n(S)$ likely outcomes, then the \emph{probability} of the event $E$ is: 
\[
P(E) = \displaystyle \frac{n(E) }{n(S)} = \displaystyle \frac{\text{number of elements in } E}{\text{number of elements in }S} 
\]

\emph{Properties of Probability} 
\begin{enumerate}[label = \arabic*. ]
%1
\item A probability is a number between 0 and 1, inclusive. \\
The closer the probability of an event to 1, the more likely the event is to happen and the closer the probability of an event to zero, the less likely it is to happen. \\
$$0 \leq P(E) \leq 1$$
%2
\item The probability of an event that cannot happen is 0.
$$ P(\varnothing) = 0$$
%3
\item The probability of an event that must happen is 1.
\item The probability of the sample space $S$ is 1.
$$P(S) =1$$

\item The probability of any two disjoint events $E_1$ and $E_2$ is the sum of the probabilities of each individual event
$$P(E_1 \cup E_2) = P(E_1) + P(E_2)$$

%4
\item The probability of any event which is not in $E$ is the difference between 1 and the probability of event $E$. 
$$P(E') = 1 - P(E)$$
$E'$ signifies ``not in E.''
