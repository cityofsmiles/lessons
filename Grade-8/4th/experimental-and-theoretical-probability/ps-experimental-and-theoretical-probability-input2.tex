\item[8. ] If the probability that a 50-year old man will still live at 70 is 37\%, then the probability that the man will die before the age of 70 years is 63\%.

%\item If a pair of dice is drawn, the probability of getting a sum of at most 12 is 1.

%\item A 7-year old boy is insured and his policy matures when he becomes 25 years old. A statistical record shows that 95,956 persons are alive at 7 years and 94,565 persons are alive at 25. With these figures the probability that a 7-year old boy will reach the maturity of his insurance is 0.9855 or 98.55\%.
