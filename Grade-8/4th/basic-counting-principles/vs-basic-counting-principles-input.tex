\textbf{Basic Counting Principles}
\begin{enumerate}[label = \arabic*. ]
%1
\item Multiplication Principle of Counting:  If one event can occur in $m$ ways,  and a second event can occur in $n$ ways, and a third event can occur in $p$ ways, and so on, then the sequence of events can occur in $m \times n \times p \times \ldots$ ways.

%2
\item Addition Principle of Counting: Suppose some event $E_1$ can occur in $m$ ways and a second event $E_2$ can occur in $n$ ways and the events $E_1$ and $E_2$ both cannot occur simultaneously, then $E_1$ or $E_2$ can occur in $m + n$ ways. \\
Mutually Exclusive Events: events that have no outcome in common
