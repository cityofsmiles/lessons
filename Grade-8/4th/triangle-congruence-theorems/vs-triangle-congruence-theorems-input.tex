SAA/AAS (Side-Angle-Angle) Theorem: 
If two angles and a non-included side of one triangle are congruent to the corresponding two angles and a non-induded side of another triangle, then the triangles are congruent.

\vspce 

LL  Congruence Theorem:  If  the  legs  of  one  right  triangle  are  congruent  to  the  legs  of  another  right  triangle,  then the triangles are congruent.

\vspce 

LA (Leg-Acute angle) Congruence Theorem:  If  a  leg  and  an  acute  angle  of  one  right  triangle  are  congruent  to  a  leg  and  an  acute angle of another right triangle, then the triangles are congruent.

\vspce 

HA (Hypotenuse-Acute angle) Congruence Theorem:  If  the hypotenuse  and  an  acute  angle  of  one  right  triangle are  congruent  to  the corresponding hypotenuse  and   acute angle of another right triangle, then the triangles are congruent.
