Fundamental Theorem of Algebra: A polynomial function $P(x) $ of degree $n$ has exactly $n$ complex zeros. 

\vspce 

Multiple Zeros of a Polynomial: If a polynomial $P(x)$ has $x-r$ occurring as a factor exactly $k$ times, then $r$ is a \textbf{zero of multiplicity k} of the polynomial function $y=P(x) $.

Finding Integral Zeros of Polynomial Functions: Let $P(x) $ be a polynomial function in $x$ with integral coefficients. Then the only possible zeros of $P(x)$ are the divisors of the constant term.
