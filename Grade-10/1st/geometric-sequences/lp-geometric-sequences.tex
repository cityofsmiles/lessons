\def \PurposeDay {The purpose of this lesson is to enable the students to solve real life problems involving geometric sequences.}  

\def \ExamplesDay {Some examples of geometric sequences are the following: 
\begin{enumerate}[label = \arabic*. ]
%1
\item The sum of even integers from 5 to 11 is 24.
%2
\item $1 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 16$
%3
%\item 
\end{enumerate}
