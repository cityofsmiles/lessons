\textbf{Arithmetic Sequence:} a sequence where every term after the first is obtained by adding a constant called the common difference

\vspce

\textbf{Common difference:} the constant difference $d$ between any two consecutive terms

\vspce

To  find  any  term  in  an  arithmetic sequence, use

$$a_{n} = a_{1} + (n - 1)d$$

To  find  $d$, use

$$d = \displaystyle \frac{a_{n} - a_{k}}{n - k} $$
