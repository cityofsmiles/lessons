\textbf{ Rational Zero Theorem:} Given a polynomial function defined by \[ {P(x) = a_nx^n+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+\ldots +a_1x+a_0}\] with integer coefficients and where ${n}$ is a non-negative integer, the possible rational zeros of $ {P(x) }$ are of the form $ {\displaystyle \frac{p}{q}}$, where ${p}$ is a factor of $ {a_0}$ and $\ {q}$ is a factor of ${a_n}$.
