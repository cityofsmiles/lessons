\textbf{Area of Sectors and Segments of a Circle}

\vspace*{1ex}

\textbf{Sector of a Circle:} a region in the circle bounded by two radii and the minor arc they determine

\vspce 

The \textbf{area of a sector} is represented by $A = \dfrac{n}{360}\pi r^2$, where $n$ is the number of degrees in the central angle of a sector.

\vspce 

\textbf{Segment of a Circle:} a region bounded by an arc and the chord of the arc

\vspce 

The \textbf{area of a segment} of a circle is found by subtracting the area of a triangle from the area of a sector. 
\[
\text A_{segment} = A_{sector}-A_{triangle}
\]
