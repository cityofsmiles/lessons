\textbf{Inscribed angle: } an angle whose vertex lies on the circle and whose sides are chords of a circle

\vspce 

The measure of an inscribed angle is \textbf{half} the measure of its intercepted arc.

\vspce 

In a circle, if two inscribed angles intercept the same arc or congruent arcs, then the angles are congruent.

\vspce 

An angle inscribed in a semicircle is a right angle and therefore the measure is equal to $90\degree$.

\vspce 

If a quadrilateral is inscribed in a circle, then its opposite angles are supplementary.
