\textbf{Intersecting Secants -- Exterior Theorem:} The measure of an angle formed by two secants that intersect in the exterior of a circle is one-half the difference of its intercepted arcs. 

\vspce 

\textbf{Tangent Point -- Secant Theorem:}  The measure of an angle formed by a tangent and a secant drawn at the point of contact is one-half the measure of its intercepted arc. 

\vspce 

\textbf{Intersecting Secants -- Interior  Theorem:} The measure of an angle formed by two secants intersecting in the interior of the circle is equal to one-half the sum of the measures of its intercepted arcs.
