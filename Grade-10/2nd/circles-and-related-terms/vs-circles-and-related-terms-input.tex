\textbf{Circle: } a set of all points in a plane that are the same distance from a fixed points called the \textbf{center} 

\vspce 

\textbf{Radius:} a segment whose endpoints are the center of a circle and a point on the circle

\vspce 

\textbf{Central angle:} an angle formed by any two distinct radii of a circle

\vspce 

\textbf{Arc:} a portion of a circle that consists of two endpoints and all the points on the circle between these two endpoints

\vspce 

\begin{enumerate}[label = \alph*. ]
%A
\item \hspce \textbf{Semicircle:} an arc whose endpoints are the endpoints of a diameter
%B
\item \hspce \textbf{Minor arc:} an arc which is less than a semicircle
%C
\item \hspce \textbf{Major arc:} an arc which is more than a semicircle
\end{enumerate} 

The degree measure of a semicircle is 180\degree. 

\vspce 

The degree measure of a minor arc is the same as the degree measure ot its corresponding central angle. 

\vspce 

The degree measure of a major arc is 360\degree \hspce minus the degree measure of its corresponding minor arc.
