\textbf{Probability of Dependent and Independent Events
}

\emph{Independent Events}: Two events are independent if the occurrence of the first event does not affect that  of the second. 

\vspce 

\emph{Dependent Events}: When the outcome of one event affects the outcome of a second event, the events are dependent.

\vspce 

\emph{Probability of the Intersection of two Independent Events}: 
If events $A$ and $B$ are independent, the probability of both events occurring is found by multiplying the probabilities of the events

\vspce 

If $A$ and $B$ are independent events in a sample space $S$, then the probability that both $A$ and $B$ occur is
\[
P(A \text{ \emph{and} } B) = P (A \cap B) = P(A) \cdot P(B)
\] 

\vspce 

\emph{Probability of Dependent Events}: 
The probability of an event $B$ occurring given that an event  $A$ has already occurred is given by
\[
P(A \text{ \emph{and} } B) = P (A \cap B) = P(A) \cdot P(B|A)
\]
