\vspce

A. %State whether the events are independent or dependent.

\begin{enumerate}[label = \arabic*. ]
%1
\item %Deni has a blue, red, and green  tie. He  also has a blue  and green shirt.  Deni chooses a random  tie and shirt for work today. 
Independent events \redcheck 

%2
\item %Amboy plays card games. He  picks a card at  random. Then without putting the first card back, he picks a second card at random. 
Dependent events \redcheck 

%3
\item %Canady  has 10 handmade sheets. She takes 6 sheets at random. Then  without putting these sheets  back, she picks 2 sheets at random.
Dependent events \redcheck 

\item %Jeff has 3 children. His first 2 children are boys. His last child is a girl.
Independent events \redcheck 

\item %A tree has 4 red flowers and 2 blue flowers. Brandy  plucks 1 flower from the tree. After some time her sister plucks a flower from the same tree.
Dependent events \redcheck 

\end{enumerate}  

B. %Solve each problem completely. 
\begin{enumerate}[label = \arabic*. ]
%1
\item %A box of chocolates contains 10 milk chocolates, 8 dark chocolates, and 6 white chocolates. Hanissa randomly chooses a chocolate, eats it, and then randomly chooses another chocolate. What is the probability that Hanissa chose a milk chocolate, and then, a white chocolate? 
P(milk chocolate and white chocolate) \redcheck \\
= P(milk chocolate) $\cdot $ P(white chocolate|milk chocolate)  \redcheck \\
$ = \dfrac{10}{24} \cdot \dfrac{6}{23}  $ \redcheck \\
=\fbox{$\dfrac{5}{46}  $} \redcheck 
 

\item %A toy box contains 12 toys, 8 stuffed animals, and 3 board games. Maria randomly chooses 2 toys for the child she is babysitting to play with. What is the probability that she chose 2 stuffed animals as the first two choices? 
P(stuffed animal and stuffed animal) \redcheck \\
= P(stuffed animal) $\cdot $ P(stuffed animal|stuffed animal)  \redcheck \\
$ = \dfrac{8}{23} \cdot \dfrac{7}{22}  $ \redcheck \\
=\fbox{$\dfrac{28}{253}  $} \redcheck 
 

\item %Nick has 4 black pens, 3 blue pens, and 2 red pens in his school bag. He randomly picks two pens out of his school bag. What is the probability that Nick chose two blue pens if he replaced the first pen back in his pocket before choosing a second pen? 
P(blue pen and blue pen) \redcheck \\
= P(blue pen) $\cdot $ P(blue pen)  \redcheck \\
$ = \dfrac{3}{9} \cdot \dfrac{2}{9}  $ \redcheck \\
=\fbox{$\dfrac{2}{27}  $} \redcheck 
 

%4
\item %A bag contains 6 black marbles, 9 blue marbles, 4 yellow marbles, and 2 green marbles. A marble is randomly selected, replaced, and a second marble is randomly selected. Find the probability of selecting a black marble, then a yellow marble. 
P(black and yellow) \redcheck \\
=  P(black) $\cdot $ P(yellow)  \redcheck \\
$ = \dfrac{6}{21} \cdot \dfrac{4}{21}  $ \redcheck \\
=\fbox{$\dfrac{8}{147}  $} \redcheck
