\emph{Mutually Exclusive Events}: events that have no outcome in common

\emph{Probability of Union of Mutually Exclusive Events}:
If $A$ and $B$ are mutually exclusive events, then
\[
P(A \text{ \emph{or} } B) = P (A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B)
\]

\emph{Probability of Union of Two Events}: 
If $A$ and $B$ are events in a sample space $S$, then the probability of $A$ or $B$ is
\[
P(A \text{ \emph{or} } B) = P (A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A\cap B)
\]
