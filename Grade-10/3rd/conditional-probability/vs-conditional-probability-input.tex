\vspace*{1ex}

For any two dependent events $A$ and $B$ with $P(B) > 0$, the conditional probability of $A$ given that $B$ has occurred is defined by

\[
P(A|B) = \displaystyle \frac{P(A\cap B)}{P(B)} 
\] 

For any two independent events $A$ and $B$ with $P(B) > 0$, the conditional probability of $A$ given that $B$ has occurred is defined by
\[P(A | B) = P(A)\]
